# Example Workflow: SaaS Churn Reduction

A complete walkthrough showing how to apply the Research-First Design methodology to reduce churn rate for a SaaS product — with focus on finding unique tactics, not just best practices.

---

## Phase 0: Discovery

**Context:** TaskFlow — project management SaaS for small teams. Monthly churn rate at 8%, goal is to reduce to 4%. Scope: cancellation flow redesign + retention strategies.

**Questions answered:**

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| WHAT are we building? | Cancellation flow (web), retention interventions, win-back touchpoints |
| WHO is this for? | Team admins who manage billing, typically 28-45, decision-makers |
| WHAT should users accomplish? | If leaving: cancel cleanly with minimal friction. If saveable: find an alternative (pause, downgrade, discount) |
| WHAT feeling should it evoke? | Respectful, not desperate. "We value you" not "Please don't go!" |
| WHAT JOB is the user hiring this? | "Let me leave without guilt" OR "Help me find a reason to stay" |
| WHAT objections might they have? | "They're going to make this hard", "I'll lose my data", "They'll spam me" |
| WHAT should they remember tomorrow? | "That was surprisingly easy, and they actually tried to help" |
| ANY constraints? | Must work on web, integrate with Stripe billing, legal requirement to allow cancellation |

**Design Brief:**
> "Redesign the cancellation experience for TaskFlow team admins to reduce churn from 8% to 4%. The flow should feel respectful and helpful — offering genuine alternatives (pause, downgrade, discount) without being manipulative. Users who do cancel should leave with a positive impression and clear path to return."

## Phase 1: Research

### Focus Identified

**By Challenge:** Reducing churn (retention) + Building trust during exit
→ Focus on: retention offers, pause options, feedback collection, graceful exits

**By Goal:** UX/Flow optimization (improving journeys)
→ Focus on: step count, friction points, decision points, recovery paths

### Research Loop Executed

```
1. LIVE SITES: Visited Spotify, Netflix, Adobe, Notion cancel flows
2. GALLERIES: Searched Mobbin for "cancellation" and "subscription cancel"
3. COMPETITORS: Visited Clay, ElevenLabs, BoldVoice cancel experiences
4. ELEMENTS: Searched "pause subscription", "retention offer", "discount modal"
5. ADJACENT: Browsed "win back" and "reactivation" patterns
6. DEVTOOLS: Inspected spacing, typography, colors on best examples
7. PAGE FLOWS: Studied complete cancel journeys on pageflows.com
8. CROSS-PLATFORM: Checked iOS cancel flows for mobile patterns
```

**Total: 25+ sites visited, 50+ screens documented, 8 deep inspections with DevTools**

### Deep Dive Results (EXACT Details)

**Clay — 7-step cancellation (inspected via live site + DevTools):**
- Step 2: "We're sorry to see you go" headline + 6 radio button reasons
- Step 4: Retention offer shows ticket-style graphic with "25% OFF FOR LIFE"
- Exact copy: "We'd love to share a special offer with you"
- Three CTAs: "Accept This Offer" (primary), "Back", "Decline Offer" (secondary)
- Step 5: Consequence screen lists EXACT features lost: "Unlimited contacts", "More frequent data enrichment", "Priority support"
- Step 7: Confirmation shows purple accent text "You won't be billed again."

**ElevenLabs — 6-step cancellation:**
- Step 3: Shows THUMBNAILS of features being lost (not just text list)
- Step 4: Multi-select feedback (CHECKBOXES, not radio) — can select "Low usage" AND "Product didn't meet needs"
- Retention: "One time offer before you go!" with "Get 30% off your next month"
- Final state: "Cancelled" badge in red, "$0" next payment, "Resume subscription" button visible

**BoldVoice — pricing/retention patterns:**
- Retention modal: Strikethrough "$149.99" → "$99.99" with exact savings visible
- Uses anchoring: original price always shown alongside discounted price
- CTA: warm amber/gold color for the discount acceptance button

### Three Lenses Applied

**Lens A: Structure**

Flow patterns discovered:
- 5-8 steps is standard (Clay: 7, ElevenLabs: 6, Spotify: 8)
- Modal-based flows dominate (prevents accidental navigation away)
- Consequence screen always BEFORE final confirm, not after

**Lens B: Visual Craft**

- Headlines: 20-28px, bold, empathetic tone ("We're sorry to see you go")
- Keep button: Primary color (green/blue), full-width or left position
- Cancel button: Ghost/secondary, gray text, smaller
- Feature loss: Uses checkmarks + thumbnail images (ElevenLabs), not just text bullets

**Lens C: Conversion & Soul**

| Company | EXACT Tactic | Why It Works |
|---------|--------------|--------------|
| Clay | "25% OFF FOR LIFE" ticket visual | Permanence ("for life") reduces "temporary fix" objection |
| ElevenLabs | Thumbnail previews of features | Loss aversion — seeing the actual UI makes loss concrete |
| BoldVoice | Strikethrough "$149.99" → "$99.99" | Anchoring + exact savings calculation visible |
| TikTok Shop | "YOU WON THE BIGGEST DISCOUNT" | Gamification — reframes cancellation as winning |

**For Flows:**
- Step count: 5-8 screens (optimal is 6 — enough for retention without frustration)
- Decision points: reason selection → offer → final confirm
- Friction reducers: "Back" always visible, progress implicit
- Recovery paths: "Resume subscription" shown immediately after cancel

### Research Summary

```
📊 RESEARCH SUMMARY
────────────────────────────────────────
Sites visited: 25+ | Screens documented: 50+ | Deep inspections: 8

WHAT I FOUND:

  Flow structure:
  • Clay — 7-step modal flow
  • ElevenLabs — 6-step modal flow  
  • Spotify — 8-step flow
  • Most use: consequence screen before final confirm

  Discount presentation (varies significantly):
  • Clay: "25% OFF FOR LIFE" — text on ticket-style graphic
  • BoldVoice: "$149.99" strikethrough → "$99.99" 
  • TikTok: "YOU WON THE BIGGEST DISCOUNT" with coupon visual

  Feature loss display:
  • Most: bullet list of feature names
  • ElevenLabs: actual UI thumbnails (screenshots of features)

  Reason collection:
  • Clay, Spotify: radio buttons (single select)
  • ElevenLabs: checkboxes (multi-select)

  Specific copy that stood out:
  • ClassPass: "We'll send you a reminder 2 days before your trial ends"
  • Clay: "You won't be billed again." (purple accent)

GAPS: Win-back email timing not covered

## Phase 2: Analyze

### Pattern Table

| Aspect | Clay | ElevenLabs | BoldVoice | TikTok | **Our Choice** |
|--------|------|------------|-----------|--------|----------------|
| Discount framing | "25% OFF FOR LIFE" | "30% off next month" | "$50 off" exact | "$100 coupon" | **"$X off for life"** (permanence + exact $) |
| Reason collection | Radio (single) | Checkbox (multi) | N/A | N/A | **Multi-select checkbox** |
| Feature loss display | Text list | Thumbnails | N/A | N/A | **Thumbnails where possible** |
| Offer language | "Special offer" | "One time offer" | "Gift just for you" | "You won" | **"One time offer"** (urgency without gamification) |
| Cancel CTA | "Decline Offer" | "Cancel Subscription" | "Proceed to cancel" | "Shop now" | **"No thanks, continue cancelling"** |

### Steal List

| Source | EXACT What | WHY It Works | How I'll Use It |
|--------|-----------|--------------|-----------------|
| Clay | "25% OFF FOR LIFE" ticket-style graphic | "For life" removes temp-fix objection; ticket visual = tangible value | Show "50% OFF FOR LIFE" after "too expensive" reason |
| ElevenLabs | Screenshot thumbnails of lost features | Loss aversion stronger with visual; abstract list < concrete UI | Show mini-screenshots of dashboard, reports, integrations |
| ElevenLabs | Multi-select checkboxes (not radio) | Users have multiple reasons; single choice loses insights | Replace radio with checkboxes, allow 1-3 selections |
| BoldVoice | Strikethrough "$149.99" → "$99.99" with exact savings | Anchoring + specific dollars > percentage | Show "$24/mo → $12/mo (save $144/year)" |
| TikTok | Scalloped coupon edge visual | Physical metaphor = perceived tangible value | Use coupon-style card for discount offer |
| ClassPass | "Reminder 2 days before" specific timing | Removes #1 anxiety about surprise charges | Add "We'll remind you 2 days before any charge" |

**Categories covered:**
- ✅ Retention offer (permanent framing: "for life")
- ✅ Objection killer (specific timing for charge reminder)
- ✅ Friction reducer (multi-select, not forced single choice)
- ✅ Visual treatment (thumbnails, coupon visual)
- ✅ Micro-detail (strikethrough pricing, exact amounts)
- ✅ Memorable element (feature thumbnails showing real UI)

## Phase 3: Design

### Persuasion Layer

| Element | Our Answer | Implementation |
|---------|------------|----------------|
| **Hook** (first 3 sec) | "Before you go — we have a one-time offer" | Modal headline after reason selection |
| **Story arc** | Reason → Offer (conditional) → Consequences → Confirm → Goodbye | 5-6 screens |
| **Objection killers** | 1. Price → $X off for life 2. Surprise charge → "2-day reminder" 3. Data loss → "Export anytime" | Inline on relevant screens |
| **Trust signals** | "Reactivate anytime" + exact pricing on button | Confirm + Goodbye screens |
| **Urgency/Scarcity** | "This offer expires in 24 hours" (only for discount) | Countdown on offer modal |
| **The memorable thing** | Feature thumbnails + "for life" discount | Consequence + Offer screens |

### Typography System

- Display: Inter/System, 28px, -0.02em tracking
- H1: 20px, medium weight
- Body: 16px, regular, 1.5 leading
- Caption: 14px, secondary color (#666)
- ALL CAPS labels: 12px, 0.06em tracking

### Color Palette

- Background: #FFFFFF / #121212 (dark mode)
- Text primary: #1A1A1A / #FFFFFF
- Text secondary: #666666 / #A0A0A0
- Primary CTA (Keep): #22C55E (green)
- Secondary CTA (Cancel): Ghost, #666666 text
- Offer accent: #F59E0B (amber) — coupon/discount
- Destructive: #EF4444 — final confirm only

### Spacing System

- Base unit: 8px
- Scale: 8, 16, 24, 32, 48, 64
- Modal padding: 32px
- Section gap: 24px
- Element gap: 16px

### The Soul (20%)

- **Bold visual choice:** Coupon-style card with scalloped edge for discount offer
- **Voice:** "We'd hate to lose you over price" (second person, empathetic)
- **Memorable detail:** Feature thumbnails showing actual UI being lost
- **Micro-interaction:** Checkmark animation when discount is applied
